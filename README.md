When the target camera user generates a system configuration backup by clicking the "Backup" button inside the mantenance page system uses the model ID, version number and the current date to name the backup file. With gathering those information by reading the report data or just by brute forcing the backup file name pattern with publicly known product information, attackers are able to download the backup files with using the `download.php?file=` endpoint.
